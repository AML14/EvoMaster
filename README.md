_EvoMaster_ ([www.evomaster.org](http://evomaster.org)) is a tool prototype 
that automatically *generates* system-level test cases.
Internally, it uses an [Evolutionary Algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolutionary_algorithm) 
and [Dynamic Program Analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_program_analysis)  to be 
able to generate effective test cases.
The approach is to *evolve* test cases from an initial population of 
random ones, trying to maximize measures like code coverage and fault detection.


At the moment, _EvoMaster_ targets RESTful APIs compiled to 
JVM 8 bytecode.
The APIs must provide a schema in [OpenAPI/Swagger](https://swagger.io) format.
The tool generates JUnit (version 4 or 5) tests, written in either Java or Kotlin.


A [short video](https://youtu.be/3mYxjgnhLEo) shows the use of _EvoMaster_ on one of the 
case studies in [EMB](https://github.com/EMResearch/EMB). 



### Examples

![](docs/img/evomaster_console.png)


The following code is an example of one test that was automatically
generated by _EvoMaster_ for a REST service called 
"scout-api" (see [EMB repository](https://github.com/EMResearch/EMB)).
The generated test uses the [RestAssured](https://github.com/rest-assured/rest-assured) library.

```
@Test
public void test_36_with500() throws Exception {
        
   String location_media_files = "";
        
   String id_0 = given().accept("application/json")
                .header("Authorization", "ApiKey moderator") // moderator
                .contentType("application/json")
                .body(" { " + 
                    " \"uri\": \"hXf3e8B3ikGtuGjT\", " + 
                    " \"name\": \"nkeUfXVTC\", " + 
                    " \"copy_right\": \"\" " + 
                    " } ")
                .post(baseUrlOfSut + "/api/v1/media_files")
                .then()
                .statusCode(200)
                .assertThat()
                .contentType("application/json")
                .body("'uri'", containsString("hXf3e8B3ikGtuGjT"))
                .body("'name'", containsString("nkeUfXVTC"))
                .body("'copy_right'", containsString(""))
                .extract().body().path("id").toString();
                
   location_media_files = "/api/v1/media_files/" + id_0;
        
   given().accept("*/*")
                .header("Authorization", "ApiKey moderator") // moderator
                .get(resolveLocation(location_media_files, baseUrlOfSut + "/api/v1/media_files/1579038228/file"))
                .then()
                .statusCode(500) // se/devscout/scoutapi/resource/MediaFileResource_268_downloadFile
                .assertThat()
                .contentType("application/json")
                .body("'code'", numberMatches(500.0));
}
```

In this automatically generated test, a new resource is first created with a _POST_ command.
The _id_ of this newly generated resource is then extracted from the _POST_ response, and used in the URL
of a following _GET_ request on a sub-resource.
Such _GET_ request does break the backend, as it returns a __500__ HTTP status code.
The last line executed in the business logic of the backend is then printed as comment, to help debugging this fault.    


The generated tests are self-contained, i.e., they 
start/stop the REST server by themselves:

```
    private static SutHandler controller = new em.embedded.se.devscout.scoutapi.EmbeddedEvoMasterController();
    private static String baseUrlOfSut;
    
    
    @BeforeClass
    public static void initClass() {
        baseUrlOfSut = controller.startSut();
        assertNotNull(baseUrlOfSut);
        RestAssured.urlEncodingEnabled = false;
    }
    
    
    @AfterClass
    public static void tearDown() {
        controller.stopSut();
    }
    
    
    @Before
    public void initTest() {
        controller.resetStateOfSUT();
    }
```

The ability of starting/resetting/stopping the tested application is critical for using the generated 
tests in _Continuous Integration_ (e.g., Jenkins, Travis and CircleCI).
However, it requires to write a [_driver_](docs/write_driver.md) to tell _EvoMaster_ how to do 
such start/reset/stop.
  

A generated test is not only going to be a sequence of HTTP calls toward a running application.
_EvoMaster_ can also set up the _environment_ of the application, like automatically adding all the
needed data into a SQL database.
At the moment, _EvoMaster_ supports _H2_ and _Postgres_ databases.

### How to Contribute

There are many ways in which you can contribute.
If you found _EvoMaster_ of any use, _the easiest
way to show appreciation is to **star** it_.
Issues and feature requests can be reported on
the [issues](https://github.com/EMResearch/EvoMaster/issues) page:  
  
* *Bugs*: as for any bug report, the more detailed
  you can be the better.
  If you are using _EvoMaster_ on an open source project,
  please provide links to it, as then it is much easier
  to reproduce the bugs.
  
* *Documentation*: if you are trying to use _EvoMaster_, but the instructions
  in these notes are not enough to get you started, 
  then it means it is a "bug" in the documentation, which then would need
  to be clarified. 
  
* *Feature Requests*: to improve _EvoMaster_,
  we are very keen to receive feature requests, although of course we cannot
  guarantee when they are going to be implemented, if implemented at all. 
  As researchers, we want to know what are the problems that engineers in industry
  do face, and that could be done to improve _EvoMaster_ to help them.
  
  
* *Pull Requests*: we are keen to receive PRs, as long as you agree
  with the license of _EvoMaster_, and as long as you are allowed by your employer to contribute
  to open-source projects. However, before making a PR, you should read
  the [notes for developers](docs/for_developers.md).  


* *Industry Collaborations*: to evaluate the effectiveness of _EvoMaster_, we need case studies.
  There are some open-source projects that can be used (e.g., which we selected and aggregated in the
  [EMB repository](https://github.com/EMResearch/EMB)).
  But open-source applications are not necessarily representative of software developed in industry.
  Therefore, we "collaborate" with different companies (e.g., [Universitetsforlaget](https://www.universitetsforlaget.no/)),
  to apply _EvoMaster_ on their systems.
      
  * *Benefits for us*: access to the source code of real, industrial systems (of course, under NDAs). 
    It makes easier to publish academic papers, and to get funding from the research councils
    to improve _EvoMaster_ even further.  
  * *Benefits for the industrial collaborators*: 
    
    1. getting priority on new features and bug fixing.
    2. "free" human resources (MSc/PhD students and researchers) that try to break your systems and
        find faults in them.    
    
* *Academic Collaborations*: we are keen to hear from students and researchers that want to 
  collaborate on topics in which _EvoMaster_ can be used on, or extended for.
  For example, it is possible to have visiting PhD students in our lab.
  However, all communications about academic collaborations should not be done here on GitHub,
  but rather by email, directly to Prof. A. Arcuri.
