# (All) Command-Line Options

_This page is still under construction_. 


All the options are defined in the `org.evomaster.core.EMConfig` class.
In the future, we will automatically generate _Markdown_ documentation from it.


For the time being, the available options can be queried by using:

`java -jar evomaster.jar --help`
